Current Executive Team members: Frank W\u00fcrthwein, University of California San Diego, OSG Executive Director Miron Livny, University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, OSG Technical Director and PI Brian Bockelman, Morgridge Institute for Research, OSG Services and Technology lead Christina Koch, University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, OSG Research Facilitation lead Derek Weitzel, University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln, Campus, NRP, and HEP representative Eric Sedore, Syracuse University, Resource contributor J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lauret, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Nuclear Physics representative Mike Stanfield, Indiana University, OSG Security lead Lisa Goodenough, Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, Fermilab representative Liz Sexton-Kennedy, Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, Fermilab representative, OSG Council chair Mark Neubauer, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, HEP representative Rob Gardner, University of Chicago, OSG Collaboration Support Tim Cartwright, University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, OSG Campus Coordinator Management Activities \u00b6 Major activities of OSG management teams include: An annual planning retreat. At this two-day meeting near the start of each fiscal year, strategies, goals, and plans for the coming year and beyond are reviewed, discussed, debated, and settled on. A work-breakdown structure (WBS). Stemming from the annual planning retreat and maintained throughout the year is a standard WBS of high-level goals and objectives, including deliverables and milestones. The Area Coordinators report progress on and update the WBS documents periodically, and the OSG Executive team is responsible for the management and supervision of the WBS throughout the year. OSG Council meetings. These are scheduled quarterly (two per year in person, two by conference call) and generally include reviews of all OSG areas and goals, as well as any other reports the Council requests. Council members provide long-term strategy and supervision of the OSG Project and its management team, including election of the Executive Director. OSG Executive Team meetings. The team meets weekly to check in on key projects and discuss particular challenges. OSG Area Coordinator meetings. Also weekly, one or two Area Coordinators present on recent accomplishments, update the group on the status of WBS goals, and discuss current or foreseeable challenges. Because every OSG functional area is represented, this is a great venue to discuss cross-area issues.

OSG Area Coordinators are asked to attend or send a delegate to ensure broad representation. (2 min) Review OSG calendar for updates (3 min) Collect topics for discussion time (30 min) Team presentation and discussion (25 min) Discussion of interesting challenges The \u201cinteresting challenges\u201d section is for current or recent challenges, especially ones that have or had elements that cut across various OSG/PATh teams. For current challenges, this is a venue to raise awareness and ask for help. For recent challenges, this is an opportunity to get the staff to think about ways in which we could have done better. The topics do not have to related to the presentation of the day, although the presenter is welcome to identify ones during their talk. Everyone is encouraged to bring interesting challenges to each meeting, and we\u2019ll get through as many as we can each time. Even better, nominate topics by emailing Tim C. in advance. Topical meetings \u00b6 Team topical meetings address one or two broad questions about a team\u2019s activities: How does it work? The team lead picks some \u201cit\u201d to talk about, with the goal of helping all OSG and PATh staff learn more about our technologies and processes. Team leads are encouraged to ask other staff what they want to learn about. What bothers me? The team lead picks some current issue or annoyance in their team\u2019s technologies, processes, or so on, and leads a discussion about what might be done to make it better. Team leads are encouraged to ask other team members about potential topics here. Otherwise, these meetings are like Regular meetings. Each team will alternate between Regular and Topical meetings when scheduled to present. Thus, team updates will occur half as often as before. Town hall meetings \u00b6 Every fourth meeting, OSG/PATh leadership (Miron, Frank, or Brian B.) will lead a meeting to discuss topics of their choice. All staff are encouraged to suggest topics in advance by emailing Tim C. All OSG and PATh staff are requested to attend monthly town hall meetings, so please note these meetings in your calendar system. Special topics meetings \u00b6 Occasionally, a staff meeting will be set aside for presentation or (more often) discussion of a special topic, which will be announced in advance.
