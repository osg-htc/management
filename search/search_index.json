The team meets weekly to check in on key projects and discuss particular challenges. OSG Area Coordinator meetings. Also weekly, one or two Area Coordinators present on recent accomplishments, update the group on the status of WBS goals, and discuss current or foreseeable challenges.

As such, it is open to all staff who contribute effort to the OSG Consortium and all PATh staff. Basic Meeting Information \u00b6 table#coordinates td { padding-top: 0.5ex; padding-bottom: 0.5ex; } When Wednesdays, 2:00\u20133:00 p.m. Central Time Online https://uwmadison.zoom.us/j/91646738583 (password sent separately) Phone (toll) See the Zoom website for phone numbers Meeting ID: 916 4673 8583 (password sent separately) Meeting Types \u00b6 There are four kinds of staff meetings: Regular meetings have a team presentation plus discussion of interesting challenges Topical meetings are focused around one or two questions for a team lead Town hall meetings occur on last Wednesdays each month and are led by Miron or Frank Special topics meetings focus on a special discussion topic or two Regular meetings \u00b6 Staff should decide for themselves when it is best to attend. OSG Area Coordinators are asked to attend or send a delegate to ensure broad representation. (2 min) Review OSG calendar for updates (3 min) Collect topics for discussion time (30 min) Team presentation and discussion (25 min) Discussion of interesting challenges The \u201cinteresting challenges\u201d section is for current or recent challenges, especially ones that have or had elements that cut across various OSG/PATh teams. For current challenges, this is a venue to raise awareness and ask for help. For recent challenges, this is an opportunity to get the staff to think about ways in which we could have done better. The topics do not have to related to the presentation of the day, although the presenter is welcome to identify ones during their talk. Everyone is encouraged to bring interesting challenges to each meeting, and we\u2019ll get through as many as we can each time. Even better, nominate topics by emailing Tim C. in advance. Topical meetings \u00b6 Team topical meetings address one or two broad questions about a team\u2019s activities: How does it work? The team lead picks some \u201cit\u201d to talk about, with the goal of helping all OSG and PATh staff learn more about our technologies and processes. Team leads are encouraged to ask other staff what they want to learn about. What bothers me? The team lead picks some current issue or annoyance in their team\u2019s technologies, processes, or so on, and leads a discussion about what might be done to make it better. Team leads are encouraged to ask other team members about potential topics here. Otherwise, these meetings are like Regular meetings. Each team will alternate between Regular and Topical meetings when scheduled to present. Thus, team updates will occur half as often as before. Town hall meetings \u00b6 Every fourth meeting, OSG/PATh leadership (Miron, Frank, or Brian B.) will lead a meeting to discuss topics of their choice. All staff are encouraged to suggest topics in advance by emailing Tim C. All OSG and PATh staff are requested to attend monthly town hall meetings, so please note these meetings in your calendar system. Special topics meetings \u00b6 Occasionally, a staff meeting will be set aside for presentation or (more often) discussion of a special topic, which will be announced in advance.
